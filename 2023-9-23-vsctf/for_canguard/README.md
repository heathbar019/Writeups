> The user of this PC was caught cheating on Valorant, can you figure out why his cheat was detected?

We are provided with two downloads, one with a .ad1 extension and another with a .ad2 extension. We are dealing with two different formats for logical images. I assumed that the files are images of the same drive and that both are provided just to give more options. After a quick google search I find out that .ad1 files can be opened with FTK imager
