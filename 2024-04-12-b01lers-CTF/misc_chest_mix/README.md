## Preface
This CTF challenge involves reverse engineering a Microsoft Excel file. This Excel file comes with pre-enabled macros that, as the challenge introduction says, mimic malicious behavior. Anti-virus will most likely flag it but do not worry, it is only meant to mimic a malicious file and no harm will come to your system!
